<h1> ShowFolder Sample </h1>

A basic Sample Extension for Adobe Bridge CC 2018 and later. It creates a Panel in Bridge(Embedded Type Extension) in Bridge.

The Extension provides a button for Choosing a Folder. Clicking on the Button opens a File Select dialog and allows the user to choose a folder. The contents of the folder are displayed in the Bridge Content panel.

It makes use of CEP APIS to display the File select Dialog and ExtendScript to show the selected folder contents in Bridge.
