<h1> HelloBridge Sample </h1>

A basic Hellow World Sample Extension for Adobe Bridge CC 2018 and later. It creates a Modal Dialog type Extension in Bridge and displays some text.

The Extension UI also has a link for CEP-Resources and documentation. The Extension makes use of CEP's openURLInDefaultBrowser() function to open the link in the default browser.

To use this sample, 

1) Download\Clone the Repo and copy the sample Extension folder to CEP supported paths. Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/tree/master/Documentation"> Bridge CEP documentation </a> for CEP Supported paths.

2) Enable Debug mode for Extensions as the extension is not signed. Refer to <a href="https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/tree/master/Documentation"> Bridge CEP documentation </a>  for using unsigned CEP extensions in Bridge.

3) Launch Adobe Bridge CC 8.0 and later.

4) Go to Window -> Extension and Click on the HelloBridge Extension.
